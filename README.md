# CNN CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes including animals and vehicles. The project covers model building, image preprocessing, prediction, and evaluation using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic yet effective CNN architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is capable of identifying objects from the following categories:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The model achieved a **test accuracy of ~72%**, which is a reasonable benchmark for a simple CNN on CIFAR-10 without advanced tuning.
